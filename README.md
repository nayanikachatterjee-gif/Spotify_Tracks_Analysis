Spotify Tracks Analysis

It is a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Challenge.

📊 The EDA Mission Briefing: This repository contains my submission for The Manhattan Project's EDA Individual Challenge. The key objective of this project is to analyze the Spotify dataset to uncover the musical and production factors that influence a song’s popularity. Through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project aims to understand how audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, duration, and acousticness contribute to a track’s success, and how these characteristics have evolved over time. The ultimate goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights that reflect changing listener preferences and modern music production styles.

🔍 Key Insights & Findings:

The analysis of the Spotify dataset led to the following key insights:-

🔹 Univariate Analysis: It focuses on examining each feature individually to understand its distribution, central tendency, and variability. It helps identify general patterns, such as which keys, tempos, or features are most common across all tracks.

🔹 Bivariate Analysis: It explores the relationship between two variables to find correlations or patterns. In this project, it helps determine how features like danceability, energy, and loudness relate to a song’s popularity.

🔹 Multivariate Analysis: It examines how multiple features interact simultaneously. It helps reveal combinations of factors—such as danceability, energy, and valence—that collectively influence a song’s success and identify characteristic patterns in popular tracks.

🔹 Time Series Analysis: It studies how key audio features and popularity metrics change over the years. It highlights evolving trends in music production, such as shifts toward shorter durations, higher danceability, and more electronic styles.
